    Legacy of the Sharingan
    <br>
    <br>
        
        I’m Joshua Sharingan, son of Jagan Sharingan, known across Singanallur as "Singai Ja"—a name spoken with both fear and reverence. My father was a legend, his Sharingan unmatched, but it came with a price. Before he fell protecting our village, he passed his eyes to me, calling it both a gift and a burden.  
        <br>
        <br>
        On my first mission, I began to understand his warning. In the forest, the air grew heavy, alive with an ancient energy. A masked shinobi appeared, his Sharingan burning brighter than mine.  
        <br>
        <br>
        “Son of Singai Ja,” he sneered.“Do you know the cost of your father’s power?”.
<br>        <br>
        I attacked, but he was faster. His Sharingan pierced my mind, dragging me into visions of my father’s last stand. Blood. Fire. His voice echoed: “Joshua, rise above the pain. Protect them.”<br>
        <br>
        When I broke free, my Sharingan had changed—evolving into the Mangekyō Sharingan. Power surged through me as I trapped him in my Genjutsu, leaving him broken.  
        <br><br>
        As I walked away, his words lingered:“The Sharingan owns you now, as it did your father.”  
        <br><br>
        I carry my father’s legacy, determined to protect the people of <span>Singanallur</span>. But sometimes, I wonder… how much of myself these eyes will take before it’s over.  
        <br><br>

        What do you think? Does this balance brevity with impact?</p>
